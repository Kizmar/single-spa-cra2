# Single-spa & create-react-app (react-scripts 2.0.4)

This is a very simple micro frontend proof of concept using three create-react-apps and single-spa. This is by no means production ready.

The changes I made were heavily influenced by [this post by Łukasz Kyć at Pragmatists](https://blog.pragmatists.com/independent-micro-frontends-with-single-spa-library-a829012dc5be). If you want more detail about what I'm doing here, you are better off checking out his post. I made a few adjustments from what he talks about, but the important changes are in the `webpack.config.prod.js` file to work with `react-scripts` version 2.0.4. I'm also using a seperate entry point file (`singleSpa.js`) instead of overwriting `index.js`. This allows us to run the app on localhost while developing (or should... that's the idea anyway, I haven't actually tried it).

I'll let the commits do the rest of the talking for me.

To run this:
- Run `yarn install` within each app directory
- In three seperate terminal windows run the following:
  - Run `yarn serve` inside `child-one`
  - Run `yarn serve` inside `child-two`
  - Run `yarn start` inside `parent`
